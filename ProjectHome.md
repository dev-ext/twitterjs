Adds twitters to your site without hanging it if Twitter is down.

Supports a multitude of options, including ignoring @replies, full control over what's show via simple templating, onTimeout functions, with or without friends Tweets and allows you to have more than one instance on your page.

Most importantly, the script runs **after** your page has loaded so if Twitter is down, it won't hold up your user's experience.

## You can now hotlink directly from Google ##
